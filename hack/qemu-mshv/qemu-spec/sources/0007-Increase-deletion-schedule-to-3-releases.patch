Subject: [PATCH] Increase deletion schedule to 3 releases
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The RHEL-9 series still keeps the rhel 7.6.0 machine types as a
special exception to our normal rule of deleting machine types
after 2 releases. The exception will go away in RHEL-10.
