- Include relevant background about existing virtualization capabilities
- Reference existing APIs, components, or workflows that are insufficient

### Desired State

- What should be possible after this feature is implemented?
- How will this integrate with existing KubeVirt patterns?
- What new capabilities will users have?

### Success Criteria

- **Functional**: What must work for this feature to be considered successful?
- **Non-functional**: Performance, security, reliability, compatibility requirements
- **User Experience**: How should this feel to cluster operators and VM users?

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (business value for KubeVirt)
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for KubeVirt stakeholders and business users
- üéØ Consider KubeVirt's architectural principles and patterns

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every KubeVirt feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it clearly
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **KubeVirt-specific underspecified areas**:
   - User types (cluster operators, VM users, platform developers)
   - Feature gate behavior and lifecycle
   - Component integration (virt-controller, virt-handler, virt-launcher, virt-api)
   - VM lifecycle impact and compatibility
   - Hardware requirements and host environment needs
   - Performance targets and resource overhead
   - Security/compliance considerations for virtualization
   - Kubernetes integration patterns and CRD changes
