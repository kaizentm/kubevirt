# KubeVirt Development Constitution

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Status**: Active  

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the immutable principles that govern all feature development within the KubeVirt project. These principles ensure consistency, quality, and architectural integrity across all contributions while supporting both traditional development approaches and emerging specification-driven development methodologies.

**KubeVirt's Mission**: To bring virtual machine management to Kubernetes through native APIs and patterns, making VMs first-class citizens in Kubernetes clusters. Every feature must honor this mission by extending Kubernetes naturally rather than creating parallel systems.

**Core Values**:
- **Native Integration**: VMs should feel like native Kubernetes workloads
- **Operational Excellence**: Reliability, observability, and maintainability are non-negotiable
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations must be built-in from the specification phase
- **Community-Driven**: Development follows inclusive, transparent governance processes
- **Quality First**: Comprehensive testing and validation before any implementation

This constitution supports multiple development approaches while maintaining architectural discipline and quality standards across all contributions.

## Article I: Specification-Driven Development Support

### Section 1.1: Enabling Spec-Driven Development
This constitution establishes the framework to **support** specification-driven development (SDD) for teams and features that choose this approach. When SDD is adopted for a feature:

- **Problem Statement**: Must clearly articulate what limitation is being addressed
- **User Stories**: Must express specific user needs as measurable outcomes  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Must provide unambiguous success conditions for each user story
- **Requirements**: Must define both functional and non-functional requirements
- **Integration Points**: Must describe how the feature interacts with existing KubeVirt components

### Section 1.2: Implementation Plans for Spec-Driven Features
When a feature follows the specification-driven approach, a detailed implementation plan **MUST** be created that translates business requirements into technical architecture. These implementation plans serve as executable blueprints that can generate consistent, maintainable code.

### Section 1.3: Traditional Development Paths
Features **MAY** follow traditional development approaches including:
- Direct implementation with design documents
- Iterative development with evolving requirements
- Prototype-first development with post-hoc documentation
- Emergency fixes and critical patches

All development approaches **MUST** still comply with the architectural principles defined in Articles II-XII of this constitution.

### Section 1.4: Specification Evolution (SDD Features Only)
For features following specification-driven development, specifications are living documents that evolve through implementation and operational feedback. Changes to specifications drive regeneration of implementation plans and code, maintaining perfect alignment between intent and reality.

## Article II: The KubeVirt Razor - Native Kubernetes Integration

### Section 2.1: The Razor Principle
**"If something is useful for Pods, we should not implement it only for VMs"**

This principle, known as **The KubeVirt Razor**, is the fundamental decision-making framework that guides all feature development. Every feature **MUST** leverage existing Kubernetes patterns and APIs rather than creating VM-specific alternatives. 

**Rationale**: This ensures:
- Consistent user experience across workload types
- Reduced cognitive load for cluster operators  
- Natural integration with existing Kubernetes tooling and workflows
- Future compatibility with Kubernetes evolution
- Reduced maintenance burden through reuse of battle-tested components

### Section 2.2: Native Workload Parity
Features **MUST NOT** grant VM users capabilities beyond what Kubernetes already provides for container workloads. Virtual machine management should feel like native Kubernetes resource management, not privileged system administration.

**Security Boundary**: Installing and using KubeVirt must never grant users any permission they do not already have regarding native workloads. A non-privileged application operator must never gain access to privileged resources by using KubeVirt features.

### Section 2.3: Choreography Over Orchestration
KubeVirt components **MUST** follow the choreography pattern where services act independently based on observed state rather than being centrally orchestrated. This architectural pattern ensures:

- **Resilient Operation**: System continues to function under partial failure conditions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Loose coupling enables independent scaling of components  
- **Kubernetes-Native Patterns**: Follows established controller reconciliation patterns
- **Self-Healing Behavior**: Components can recover and repair state autonomously

### Section 2.4: Integration Strategy
When extending Kubernetes for VM management, prefer:
1. **Extension over Replacement**: Extend existing Kubernetes APIs rather than replacing them
2. **Composition over Custom**: Compose existing primitives rather than building custom solutions
3. **Standards over Proprietary**: Follow established standards (CNI, CSI, CRI) over proprietary interfaces
4. **Upstream over Fork**: Contribute improvements upstream rather than maintaining forks

## Article III: Feature Gate Discipline and Release Management

### Section 3.1: Alpha-First Development
All new features **MUST** begin life disabled by default behind a feature gate. **No exceptions**.

**Graduation States**:
- **Alpha**: Experimental features, disabled by default, may change without notice
- **Beta**: Stable API, enabled by default in development clusters, backward compatibility within beta
- **GA (General Availability)**: Production-ready, enabled by default, strong backward compatibility commitment
- **Deprecated**: Scheduled for removal, disabled by default, migration paths provided
- **Discontinued**: Removed, no option to enable

### Section 3.2: Feature Gate Implementation Requirements

No implementation code shall be written before:
1. Comprehensive tests are written expressing the required behavior
2. Tests are validated to correctly capture requirements and edge cases
3. Tests are confirmed to FAIL (Red phase of TDD) 
4. User/reviewer acceptance of test specifications
5. Clear success criteria established for when tests should pass
