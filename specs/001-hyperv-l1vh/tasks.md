---

## Constitutional Pre-Flight Checklist âœ…

**MANDATORY**: All constitutional gates must be verified before implementation begins.

### âœ… Simplicity Gate
- [x] **â‰¤3 Go packages**: Implementation uses only 2 packages (converter + featuregate)
- [x] **No premature optimization**: Direct, minimal L1VH detection and fallback
- [x] **Complexity justified**: Zero complexity - simple feature gate + hypervisor detection

### âœ… Anti-Abstraction Gate  
- [x] **Framework trust**: Direct libvirt/QEMU integration, no wrapper layers
- [x] **Single model**: One hypervisor detection path, no parallel systems
- [x] **Existing patterns**: Uses established KubeVirt converter patterns

### âœ… Integration-First Gate
- [x] **Real environment testing**: L1VH cluster testing prioritized over mocks
- [x] **Contract-driven**: Clear contracts for hypervisor selection behavior
- [x] **Component boundaries**: Minimal change to converter, zero change to other components

### âœ… KubeVirt Razor Gate
- [x] **"Useful for Pods" principle**: No VM-specific APIs, transparent optimization
- [x] **No privileged capabilities**: Uses existing Kubernetes resource patterns
- [x] **Choreography pattern**: Components act independently on observed state

### âœ… Security by Design Gate (Article XI)
- [x] **Trust model documented**: Clear boundaries between KubeVirt and underlying technologies
- [x] **Integration points identified**: All KubeVirt-controlled security touchpoints analyzed
- [x] **Security responsibilities scoped**: KubeVirt security limited to integration layer only
- [x] **Threat model complete**: Comprehensive analysis focusing on KubeVirt integration security
- [x] **Security testing strategy**: Security tests focused on integration points, not hypervisor security

### âœ… Observability Gate (Article XII)
- [x] **Metrics strategy defined**: Prometheus metrics for L1VH operations and performance
- [x] **Logging standards compliance**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- [x] **Debug capabilities designed**: CLI tools and debug endpoints for troubleshooting
- [x] **Alerting and SLA definitions**: Operational alerts and performance SLA monitoring

**ðŸš¨ CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE VERIFIED - PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION**

**Prerequisites**: ALL TESTS WRITTEN, REVIEWED, AND APPROVED  
**Estimation**: 1-2 days  
**Constitutional Requirement**: Only after TDD Red phase completed

#### Task 2.1: Feature Gate Registration
**Prerequisites**: Feature gate tests written and failing  
**Definition of Done**: `HyperVL1VH` feature gate registered and functional

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] **Feature Gate Implementation**

const (
    HyperVL1VH featuregate.FeatureGate = "HyperVL1VH"
)

#### Task 2.2: Transparent Hypervisor Detection
**Prerequisites**: Converter tests written and failing  
**Definition of Done**: virt-launcher automatically selects L1VH when available

**Current System Analysis**:
- **Domain Type**: Currently defaults to `"kvm"` (set by api/defaults.go)
- **KVM Detection**: Converter checks `/dev/kvm` exists, sets `domain.Spec.Type = "qemu"` if missing and `AllowEmulation=true`
- **No Function Called**: There is NO existing `detectHypervisorType` or `detectQEMUKVMType` function

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] **L1VH Ensurer Logic**: Add L1VH Ensurer to existing converter flow
  - File: `pkg/virt-launcher/virtwrap/converter/converter.go` 
  - Location: In `Convert_v1_VirtualMachineInstance_To_api_Domain` function, after existing KVM check
  - Behavior: Ensure L1VH capability and override default "kvm" type

```go
// In Convert_v1_VirtualMachineInstance_To_api_Domain function, AFTER existing kvmPath check:

// Note: domain.Spec.Type remains "kvm" (default) if L1VH unavailable 
if featuregate.DefaultFeatureGate.Enabled(featuregate.HyperVL1VH) {
    if hasL1VHSupport() {
        // Update domain spec accordingly
    }
}

// L1VH Ensurer (when feature gate enabled)
func hasL1VHSupport() bool {
    // Simple validation may look like:
    _, err := os.Stat("/dev/mshv")
    return err == nil
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Ensure L1VH capability suport when feature gate enabled + `/dev/mshv` available
- [ ] Graceful fallback to default "kvm" when L1VH unavailable  
- [ ] Zero impact on existing converter functionality (preserves existing KVM logic)
- [ ] Converter tests pass (Green phase of TDD)
- [ ] Implementation follows constitutional anti-abstraction principles

#### Task 2.3: Domain XML Integration

- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: Clear behavior when L1VH requirements not met

## Risk Mitigation Tasks

### Environment Setup Risk
- **Risk**: L1VH test environment delays integration testing
- **Mitigation**: Start with mocked environment, validate with real environment when ready
- **Fallback**: Alternative L1VH environment provision plan

### Dependency Validation Risk
- **Risk**: Unknown libvirt/QEMU version compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**: Task 0.2 validates dependencies in parallel with development
- **Fallback**: Documented minimum version requirements

### Memory Overhead Accuracy Risk (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Risk**: L1VH memory overhead differs from KVM calculations, causing resource allocation issues
- **Impact**: Could cause VM scheduling failures, memory pressure, or cluster capacity miscalculation
- **Mitigation**: Task 2.4 validates overhead accuracy early in implementation
- **Fallback**: Conservative overhead estimation until accurate L1VH measurements available
- **Timeline**: Must complete before scaling testing to avoid resource allocation problems

### Process Memory Management Risk (NEW - MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Risk**: QEMU memory limit logic incompatible with mshv, causing VM stability issues
- **Impact**: Could cause memory-related VM crashes or poor performance
- **Mitigation**: Task 2.5 validates memory management compatibility
- **Fallback**: Implement mshv-specific memory management if needed

### Timeline Risk
- **Risk**: Sequential task dependencies could cause deadline slip
- **Mitigation**: Maximum parallel development with environment setup running alongside coding
- **Updated**: Memory research (2.4) can run in parallel with basic implementation
- **Monitoring**: Daily progress tracking via GitHub Issues

### Security Integration Risk
- **Mitigation**: Security considerations built into all tasks, not separate review
- **Frequency**: Continuous validation throughout development

### Performance Validation Risk
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing integrated into E2E tests
- **Timeline**: No separate performance phase, validated continuously
- **Updated**: Memory overhead validation ensures performance measurements are accurate

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub Issues**: Convert each task into a GitHub Issue for tracking and assignment
2. **Environment Setup**: Start Task 0.1 (L1VH environment) in parallel with development  
3. **Begin TDD**: Start Task 1.1 (Contract Tests) immediately with mocked L1VH environment
4. **Parallel Development**: Execute Tasks 0.2 (Build System) and 1.1 (Contract Tests) simultaneously
5. **Constitutional Review**: Validate all constitutional gates remain met throughout development

---

*This task breakdown follows the KubeVirt Constitution v1.0 and implements spec-driven development with transparent Hyper-V L1VH support that maintains 100% backward compatibility while eliminating nested virtualization performance penalties.*
